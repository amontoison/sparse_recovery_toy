We present a method of identifying the sparsity of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) when the signal is noisy. In particular, we consider the case where signal has some missing values. The conjugate structure of DFT makes the optimization in complex field difficult, so we transfer the problem to LASSO in real field. We introduce how to apply interior point method to solve LASSO. Besides, the orthogonal structure of inverse Discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) allows us to greatly reduced the storage. Also the operations of computing Newton direction is linear in problem size. Thus, our method is practical and scalable.
